# Github Actions for Bioconductor

This repository holds some GitHub actions that may be useful for those developing or maintaining R packages that will be hosted by the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) project.  These actions are built upon the [GitHub Actions for the R languarge](r-lib/actions) and should be considered complementary to them.  It's also recommended to checkout the [biocthis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocthis/) package which provides templates and functions for setting up GitHub Actions workflows for Bioconductor packages.

The actions currently hosted here are:

- [grimbough/bioc-actions/setup-bioc] 
- [grimbough/bioc-actions/run-bioc-check]
